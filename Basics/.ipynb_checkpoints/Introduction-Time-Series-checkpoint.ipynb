    "# Key Components of Time Series\n",
    "A time series can be broken down into four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Trend** – The overall direction in which the data is moving (increasing, decreasing, or stable).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: The long-term rise in Tesla stock prices.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "2.**Seasonality** – Repeating patterns at fixed intervals (daily, weekly, yearly).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Ice cream sales increase in summer and decrease in winter.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3.**Cyclic Variations** – Fluctuations that are not fixed but occur due to business or economic cycles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Economic recessions affecting stock prices.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "4.**Residual (Irregularity/Noise)** – Random variations that cannot be explained by trend, seasonality, or cycles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "       Example: Stock price fluctuations due to unexpected news."

    "# Types of Time Series Data\n",
    "1.**Stationary Time Series** – No trend, no seasonality, constant mean and variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: White noise signals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Non-Stationary Time Series** – Has trends, seasonality, or changing variance over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: GDP growth over decades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply many statistical models, we need to convert non-stationary data into stationary using techniques like differencing or log transformation."
